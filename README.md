# cations



*Ready to make productivity a habit?*

**cations** is a lightweight application that helps you build and maintain good habits through incremental progress. Using this application, you can apply the philosophy of leading productivity systems, such as James Clear's "Atomic Habits", to achieve significant long-term success in a manageable and realistic way.

**cations** is designed to run entirely in the terminal, allowing you to use it easily and conveniently. User-friendliness and efficiency are prioritized, so you can focus on completing your habits.



## Quick Start

Follow these steps to install **cations** and get started right away.

*Note: This application requires Python 3 and pip3 to be installed on your system.*

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alcryst/cations.git
```

2. Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd cations
```

3. Run the setup file:

```

4. Once installation has completed, you will be able to start the application by simply entering the command:

```

5. To use the application again, simply enter the above command.



## Usage

Each habit is represented by an "ion". When creating your ion, name it after a habit you want to repeat each day - for example, "Practice the piano" or "Write a line of code". Make it simple and easy to complete, to inspire you to get started and make consistent progress; once you've achieved consistency then you can slowly start to increase the intensity of your habit (and change the name of your ion if you wish).

You can complete each ion every day to extend your streak: the number of consecutive days that you've completed an ion. If you miss a day, your streak will reset to 0. Don't be demotivated, though; the important part is getting back on track.
